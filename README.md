[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/888165960.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14498406)

## Overview 
This is the final project for GEOG 5463: Fundamental of Earth Data Science Class.  It examines soil saturation, slope, and modeled climate temperatures  for Grand Teton and Rocky Mountain National Parks, with the goal for making a habitat suitability model for Tetraneuris Grandiflora (aka Old-Man-of-the-Mountain), with an emphasis on modeling where this wildflower might be found in the future.  It uses data from the Polaris Soil Project, the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, the National Park Service, and the  Northwest Knowledge Multivariate Adaptive Constructed (MACA) Datasets.

## Code Repository 
The repository is set up in the following way 
    img: Images and plots, in jpg or html format, to be used with the portfolio post 
    notebooks: Code in jupyter notebook.  Also has subfolder for practice notebooks 
## Running the Code 
The code runs from the following Juypter notebook: Tetraneuris-grandiflora_Portfolio_Post.ipynb

Perquisite to run it on your machine:

    1. Miniconda or similar python packages installed on your machine 
    2. Earth Analytics Environment(instructions on how to download and use here: https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env)
    3. VScode or similar for running Juypter notebooks on your machine 

To run: 
    1. Open in VS code be either fork or download 
    2. Make sure earth analytics environment is running 
    3. Select the earth analytics environment when asked what python kernal to run 
    4. Run code


## Future Work 
So far, all the data has been plotted. What remains:
    1. Reproject everything to each other 
    2. Build the fuzzy logic model 
    3. Compare habitat suitability from different climate models
