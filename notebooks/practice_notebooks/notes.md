Fuzzy logic works by combinding 3 raster data sets layered on top of each other using raster math, you can start to get maps together

Well Drained soil = < 3in/hr https://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov/references/public/FL/Part_652_Chapter_2_FL_Supplement.pdf, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_conductivity


Slopes < 45 degrees for meadows 

Temapture Increase = treeline increase, compare vs baseline for meadows https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17550870802273411#d1e267

First Part of the Prject 
Create your project GitHub repository with a README, license, .gitignore, and at least one Jupyter notebook.
Choose your species, if you are not using our example of sorghastrum nutans. We do recommend that you use a plant species, so that the data we are accessing is the most useful.
Define at least TWO study sites using a shapefile. If you are using the example, you can download the U.S. National Grassland boundaries. For some other species, that might not make as much sense -- you could consider looking at county boundaries or national parks. Keep in mind that some of our data sources only cover the continental U.S., so you should pick something in that area.
As we did with the multispectral data in the redlining coding challenge, download, process, merge, and plot a variable from the POLARIS soil dataset. pH is a good place to start if you aren't sure what to do -- you should be able to find good information about what pH range is suitable for sorghastrum nutans and many other plant species. Note that this soil data is hopefully a bit easier to process because 1) there are no spectral bands to manage and 2) there are no clouds to mask in this image.
